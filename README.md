# AoC_24
All python files for Advent of Code 2024 to be inspected. As the the reason is "to prevent the use of stolen or AI generated code among the winners" I have uploaded all versions of my code. For most days __a.py will solve part 1 and the last letter will solve part 2. If you want me to specify anything else then just let me know with an email.
